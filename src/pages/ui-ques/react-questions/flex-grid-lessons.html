- display: flex
- justify-content > for main axis
- align-items > cross axis
- flex-direction
- center a div
- {gap, flex-wrap, align-content, flex-shrink[1,0], flex-grow[0.1]}
  - to have flex-shrink logically we have to stop flex-wrap
  - flex-(grow or shrink) with min-width and mx-width will show some noticeable behavior
    - a limited shrink and grow
- align-self
- one common approach for navbar
  - [1]....[2][3][4]
  - [margin-right: auto] .... [display:flex; justify-content:flex-end; align-items:flex-start]

- flex: 1 1 0
- flex: grow shrink basis
- [flex-grow] => 0, 1
- [flex-shrink] => 1, 0
- [flex-basis] => auto, (any px value)
  - flex-basis has higher priority than width of element
  - flex-basis: 0  is most useful to let all flex items be of same width

- display: flex will cause items to be in a row
  - wrapping may cause extra space on small screen
  - solution can be media-query to switch from flex-direction: row to column
- we can adopt Netflix carousal approach:
  - display: flex; flex-wrap: no-wrap; gap: 1rem; overflowx: scroll; 
  - for seeing 1 card at a time, let parent have scroll-snap-type
    - and child will have scroll-snap-align
- grid solution is:
  - display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(amount, size)
    - grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fix, minmax(300px, 1fr))
